<h2 align="center">About me</h2>
I am a machine learning engineer, python lover, and chess addict. 

<h3 align="center">Resume</h3>

**Currently:** Sr. ML Engineer @tasq
- Segmentation, anomaly detection, classification, and categorization of high frequency signals, at scale. Projects include:
  - Live anomaly detection and event categorization/identification stack
  - Optimization using sensor data, both naive historical and (CURRENT WORK) using reinforcement learning
  - Signal segmentation accurate enough to identify when sensors meant to detect segments are broken
  - Fast multidimensional pattern matching algorithm
 

**Previous affiliations and collaborations:**
- Stanford AIMI 
  - contrastive multimodal deep learning

- NASA Goddard
  - [Automated Spectroscopy](https://github.com/josephsdavid/autospec)
  - Presented as a talk at ACM Astrochemical complexity conference in 2020

- SMU
  - Masters
  - Published paper on using attention on [sEMG signals for smart prosthetics](https://github.com/josephsdavid/semg_repro), published to [ML4H 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03645.pdf)
